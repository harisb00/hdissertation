    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
     <p> Hi! I am a third year Student at Brunel University who has created this website as my Final Year Project. I was always told that University would be the most exciting time in my life and that I will do so many activities and experience so many different life experiences. However, what I was not told was that University is incredibly different to every form of education that we had done prior to University.</p>

     <p> I am a student who came to this country when I was 9 years of age. I had to learn a lots of new things so that I would treat the culture here with respect and learn to fit in with the country's commoners. I wished there was a guide that taught me these basics because it took me lots of trial and error to understand the culure and really start to fit in. That is why this website exists.</p>

    <h2>Our Aims</h2>
     <p> I have made this website for new University students who would like to learn the basics of living within University. University is already challenging in the academic aspects, we would prefer for the other aspects to be less challenging through providing you with useful information that would help you in the real world. Not only that, but for some students, this would be the first time that we have lived outside of home by ourselves. To fully enjoy our University experience, we should be prepared to tackle any issues that come ahead and I feel that this website will help you in becoming a more independent and mature version of yourself. Feel free to explore the websites vast amount of information!</p>

     <p> Our aims are the following:</p>
     <li>1. Educate users about Physical Health within Univeristy Life</li>
     <li>2. Educate users who are new to university culture about what to expect</li>
     <li>3. Educate users on what options they have outside of University</li>
     <li>4. Educate users about ways they can be effective in their learning for University</li>
